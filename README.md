# marthaTools

Some functions I use over and over again. Not super well documented because they're mostly just for me.

## Installation
If you don't already have it installed, you'll need the *devtools* package.
  library(devtools)
  install_github('supermartha/marthaTools')
  
## Uses
* **step_up()** and **step_down()**: functions for building regression models.
* **modelToLatex()**: for saving regression models as nice LaTeX tables. (Existing packages didn't do what I want.)
* **getNthElement()**: for getting the Nth element of a string
